## 🔧 Setup Required

1. **SQLite Database**: 
   - Database is created automatically in `data/volunteer.db`

   - Optionally set `DATABASE_PATH` in `.env.local` to customize location

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Set JWT_SECRET (use a strong secret in production)
   - Configure email settings (optional)
   - Optionally set DATABASE_PATH for custom database location

3. **Create Admin User**:
   ```bash
   npm run create-admin admin@example.com admin123 "Admin User"
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 All Requirements from SRS Met

### Functional Requirements (FR):
- ✅ FR1: User Registration with accessibility preferences
- ✅ FR2: Login/Authentication
- ✅ FR3: NGO Profile
- ✅ FR4: Post Opportunities
- ✅ FR5: Search & Filter
- ✅ FR6: Apply for Opportunities
- ✅ FR7: Dashboard (for all user types)
- ✅ FR8: Notifications (email notifications implemented)

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):
- ✅ NFR1: Security (password hashing, JWT tokens, data encryption in transit)
- ✅ NFR2: Performance (optimized queries, indexes)
- ✅ NFR3: Usability (WCAG 2.1 guidelines, accessible UI)
- ✅ NFR4: Availability (ready for deployment)
- ✅ NFR5: Portability (web-based, mobile-responsive)

## 📝 Notes

- The system uses a **hybrid approach**: API calls with localStorage fallback for development/testing
- Email notifications work in development mode (logs to console) if SMTP is not configured
- All API routes include proper error handling and authentication checks
- TypeScript is used throughout for type safety
- The codebase follows Next.js 16 App Router conventions

## 🎉 Project Status: COMPLETE
